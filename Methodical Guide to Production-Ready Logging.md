# Methodical Guide to Production-Ready Logging

> Stop drowning in unhelpful log noise. Follow these twelve best practices to turn logs into a **powerful debugging and observability tool**.

---

## 1  Start With Objectives

Before writing a single `logger.info(...)`, answer:
1. What are the critical operations of this service?
2. Which KPIs matter to the business?
3. What context will 3 a.m-you need to fix incidents?

Log **with purpose**, not "spray-and-pray".

---

## 2  Choose the Right Log Level

| Level  | When to Use | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `INFO` | Normal, business-valuable events | `User completed checkout`, `OrderID=123` |
| `WARN` | Something feels off but still works | `Payment latency high` |
| `ERROR`| Failing operations | `DB connection failed` |
| `FATAL`| Service can't continue | `Out of memory – shutting down` |

Default to `INFO` in prod, but design the ability to **increase verbosity on demand** (feature flags, env vars, etc.).

---

## 3  Adopt Structured Logging

Write logs as **key-value JSON** (or similar) so machines can parse them easily.

```json
{
  "ts": "2023-10-02T13:45:12Z",
  "level": "error",
  "msg": "DB connection failed",
  "db.host": "orders-prod.cluster",
  "request_id": "a1b2c3"
}
```

Frameworks: Bunyan, pino, Zap (Go), logrus, Serilog, Winston…  If legacy apps emit plain text, transform with tools like **Vector**.

---

## 4  Provide Rich Context

Include the **Who, What, Where, Why**:
* `request_id` / trace ID
* `user_id`
* Environment (service, pod, region)
* Error stack traces
* System state (DB healthy? Cache hit rate?)

> Logs are your application's flight data recorder—make them replayable.

---

## 5  Implement Log Sampling

High-traffic endpoints can flood storage. Instead:
* **Sample successes** (e.g., 20 %).
* Keep **all errors**.
* Dynamically adjust sample rate on spikes.

OpenTelemetry & many SDKs support probabilistic sampling out of the box.

---

## 6  Emit Canonical Log Lines / Traces

For each request emit **one summary log** (or a distributed trace) containing:
* Endpoint & parameters
* Duration & latency breakdown
* Result status / error code
* Resource consumption (DB ms, cache ms)

Less detective work, quicker MTTR.

---

## 7  Centralize & Aggregate Logs

Forward all service logs to a single platform (ELK, Loki, Splunk, Datadog…).
Benefits:
* Cross-service correlation
* Unified search & dashboards
* No more ssh-and-grep across prod boxes

---

## 8  Define Retention Policies Early

Example tiered policy:
* **ERROR / audit logs** → 90-365 days
* `INFO` / success logs → 30 days
* High-volume debug logs → 7 days, cold storage or delete

Set TTLs before your first surprise cloud bill.

---

## 9  Secure Your Logs

1. **Encrypt in transit** (TLS)  
2. **Encrypt at rest** (disk, S3 SSE)  
3. **Role-based access control**  
4. Audit who accessed which logs, when.

---

## 10  Never Log Sensitive Data

Prevent leaks of passwords, tokens, credit cards:
* Use structured logging with explicit fields (easier to whitelist).
* Add runtime filters/redactors (e.g., OpenTelemetry Collector processors).
* Validate by scanning images/artifacts during CI.

---

## 11  Minimize Performance Impact

* Choose an efficient logger (Zap, slog, pino…).
* Use asynchronous / buffered writers.
* Log to a dedicated disk/volume.
* Load-test with logging enabled to catch bottlenecks.

---

## 12  Remember: Logs ≠ Metrics

* **Logs** → Detailed facts for post-mortem debugging.  
* **Metrics** → Real-time numbers for alerting.

Use both: metrics tell you *when* to look, logs tell you *why*.
