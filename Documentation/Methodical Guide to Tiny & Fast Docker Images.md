# Methodical Guide to Tiny & Fast Docker Images

> Follow these steps to shrink your Docker image from **gigabytes** to **megabytes**, accelerate build times, and improve security. The examples use a React/Node application, but the concepts apply to any stack.

## 1  Pick a Minimal Base Image

| Typical Base | Size | Minimal Alternative | Size | Notes |
|--------------|------|---------------------|------|-------|
| `node:latest` | ≈ 1 GB | `node:alpine` | ≈ 155 MB | Alpine strips the OS to bare essentials. |
| `python:3` | ≈ 900 MB | `python:3-alpine` | ≈ 59 MB | Verify native-module compatibility. |
| any‐distro | — | **distroless** | *tiny* | No shell/pm. Extra setup required. |

**Tip:** Use a full image during dev for convenience, then switch to a minimal variant in production.

## 2  Leverage Layer Caching

Docker reuses unchanged layers between builds. Order instructions from *least* to *most* volatile.

```dockerfile
# ❌ Anti-pattern – code changes bust cache early
COPY . .
RUN npm ci --production

# ✅ Cache-friendly pattern
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --production    # Cached unless deps change
COPY . .                   # Only this layer rebuilds on code change
```

Cache invalidation happens if:
1. The copied file(s) change.
2. The Dockerfile instruction itself changes.
3. Any previous layer changes.

---

## 3  Trim the Build Context with `.dockerignore`

Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude anything not needed for the *image* (e.g., `node_modules`, tests, local env files).

```
# .dockerignore
node_modules
coverage
.env
.git
```

Smaller context ⇒ faster upload to the Docker daemon/cloud.

## 4  Squash Clean-Up Commands into One Layer

Each `RUN` adds an immutable layer. Deleting files in a later layer **does not** erase them from previous ones.

```dockerfile
# BAD – leaves data in earlier layers
RUN apk add --no-cache build-base \
    && npm ci --production
RUN rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* /root/.npm

# GOOD – single layer keeps only final state
RUN apk add --no-cache build-base \
    && npm ci --production \
    && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* /root/.npm
```

---

## 5  Use Multi-Stage Builds

Compile/pack in a **builder** stage, then copy artefacts into a clean **runtime** stage.

```dockerfile
# --- Builder Stage ---
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build         # produces static files in /app/dist

# --- Runtime Stage ---
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Result: **~50 MB** instead of hundreds.

---

## 6  Analyze & Auto-Optimize

• **dive** – TUI to inspect every layer and its size.  
• **docker-slim** – one-command minifier & security hardener (can cut size ×30).

---

## 7  Recap Checklist

- [ ] Minimal base image chosen (Alpine or distroless).
- [ ] Layer caching optimized (copy deps files first).
- [ ] `.dockerignore` excludes bloat & secrets.
- [ ] Clean-ups consolidated into one `RUN`.
- [ ] Multi-stage build separates build & runtime.
- [ ] Optional: analyze with **dive**, shrink with **docker-slim**.

✨ **Enjoy lightning-fast builds and lean, secure containers!**
