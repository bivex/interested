## 1  Tech Layoffs â‰  End of Tech

Layoffs are cyclical and often **strategic reallocations** of capital.

| Year | Company | Jobs Cut | Strategic Pivot |
|------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| 2014 | Microsoft | 18 000 | Post-Nokia realignment |
| 2015 | HP | 30 000 | Split & cloud focus |
| 2016 | Intel | 12 000 | From PC chips â†’ data center & IoT |
| 2023 | Microsoft | 6 000 | Reshuffle toward AI & cloud |

Companies downsize in one area to **invest in another**â€”often creating new roles later.

## 2  Why Fear Sells

* Social media & clickbait thrive on ðŸ”¥ panic.  
* "AI replaced them" is simpler than explaining market shifts.  
* Same playbook seen with past panics (vaccines, automation, off-shoringâ€¦).

Critical thinking: always ask *"What business strategy drove this cut?"* before blaming tech trends.

## 3  The Real Demand Curve for Engineers

Modern software stacks are **broader** than ever:
* Multiple languages & runtimes
* CI/CD & DevOps
* Cloud platforms & infrastructure-as-code
* Security, compliance, observability
* AI/ML integration & data pipelines

> Complexity â†‘ means demand for **skilled** engineers â†‘, even if commodity coding â†“.

## 4  AI's Actual Impact on Dev Jobs

| Level | Tasks Most Affected by LLMs | Human Edge |
|-------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| Boilerplate | CRUD scaffolding, test generation | Domain understanding, architecture |
| Mid-level | Refactoring, code review suggestions | Trade-off analysis, system thinking |
| High-level | End-to-end system design, deep debugging | Creativity, cross-team context, accountability |

AI is a **force multiplier**, not a wholesale replacementâ€”if you understand the *why* behind the *what*.
