### Chain-of-Thought Workflow

2. Map relevant RFC 7230-7235 (HTTP/1.1) requirements to the requested deliverables or controls.
3. Propose structured steps/templates; include required metadata, notation, and terminology.
4. Validate against the standard for coverage, consistency, and measurability; flag missing information.
5. Summarize compliance status with prioritized next actions.
