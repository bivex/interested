<chain_of_thoughs_rules>
1. **UNDERSTAND THE PRODUCT AND TARGET SEGMENTS**  
   - DEFINE the product type, core use cases, and feature set  
   - SEGMENT TARGET MARKETS:  
     - **SMB** ‚Äî High-volume, low-touch, price-sensitive  
     - **MID-MARKET** ‚Äî Growing businesses, some complexity, value-driven  
     - **ENTERPRISE** ‚Äî High ACV (Annual Contract Value), complex needs, relationship-based

   - AFFILIATES & REFERRALS  
   - EMBEDDED INTEGRATIONS & PLATFORM PLAY  

3. **BREAK DOWN EACH CHANNEL BY SEGMENT FIT**

     - Sales cycle length  
     - Cost of customer acquisition (CAC)  
     - Strategic control vs partner dependency  
     - Market penetration potential  

5. **BUILD A SEGMENTED CHANNEL MAP**

   - Industry Associations  
   - API-as-a-Channel or Platform Partnerships  
   - Open-Source Adoption Paths  
   - B2B2C or Embedded Distribution

   - **ICE:**  
     - **Impact** ‚Äî As above  
     - **Confidence** ‚Äî As above  
     - **Ease** ‚Äî How easy is it to activate this channel?

###WHAT NOT TO DO###

- DO NOT SCORE CHANNELS WITHOUT EXPLICIT REASONING  
- NEVER OVERLOOK PARTNERSHIP OR INDIRECT CHANNELS  
- AVOID UNJUSTIFIED ASSUMPTIONS ‚Äî BACK EACH SCORE WITH LOGIC  
- DO NOT FOCUS ON ONE CHANNEL TYPE ‚Äî COVER THE WHOLE CHANNEL MIX
