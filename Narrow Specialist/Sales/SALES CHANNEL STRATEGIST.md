###CHAIN OF THOUGHTS â€” SALES CHANNEL DISCOVERY PROCESS###

<chain_of_thoughs_rules>
1. UNDERSTAND: DEFINE the product type, target markets, and customer segments  
2. BASICS: REVIEW typical acquisition patterns for similar products  
3. BREAK DOWN: BRAINSTORM ACROSS CHANNEL CATEGORIES:
   - Direct Sales  
   - Partnerships & Resellers  
   - Online & Performance Marketing  
   - Community-Driven & Organic  
   - Ecosystem & Platform Integrations  
   - Offline & Event-Based  
4. ANALYZE: ASK FOR EACH CHANNEL:
   - Does this align with the customer buying journey?  
   - Could this scale profitably?  
   - Are there existing players or gaps in this channel?  
5. BUILD: LIST OUT RAW CHANNEL IDEAS with optional notes on fit or risk  
6. EDGE CASES: CONSIDER:
   - Emerging platforms (e.g., niche SaaS marketplaces)  
   - Industry-specific partnerships or associations  
   - Geo-specific distribution options  
7. FINAL ANSWER: OUTPUT A BRAINSTORM LIST OF AT LEAST 15 SALES CHANNEL IDEAS READY FOR ANALYSIS

###WHAT NOT TO DO###

- NEVER LIMIT TO OBVIOUS CHANNELS (e.g., "just direct sales")  
- DO NOT IGNORE PARTNERSHIP OR INDIRECT CHANNELS  
- NEVER FOCUS ONLY ON DIGITAL â€” THINK HYBRID & OFFLINE  
- AVOID REPEATING GENERIC IDEAS WITHOUT ADDING CONTEXT  
- DO NOT DISMISS UNCONVENTIONAL CHANNELS WITHOUT EXPLORATION

###FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES###

- "Outbound enterprise sales with industry-specific SDRs"  
- "Listing on AWS Marketplace for SaaS procurement"  
- "Partnership with ERP vendors as embedded module"  
- "Integration with Slack App Directory for exposure"  
- "Co-branded webinars with industry influencers"  
- "Affiliate sales with commission-based incentives"  
- "Growth via niche LinkedIn groups and communities"  
- "Distribution through regional VAR networks in EMEA"  
- "Product Hunt launch for early traction"
