4. ANALYZE: DETERMINE which features would resonate most with clients in terms of:
   - Cost savings, productivity, customer retention, risk reduction, compliance  
   - Differentiation from competitor solutions  
5. BUILD: CREATE a SALES FEATURE MAP listing:
   - Feature name and code reference  
   - VALUE PROP (business impact)  
   - USP (why this matters)  
   - PITCH-LINE (sales-friendly language)  
6. EDGE CASES: PAY EXTRA ATTENTION TO:
   - Automation tools  
   - AI-driven functionalities  
   - Integrations that reduce friction or enable scaling

- AVOID GENERIC STATEMENTS ‚Äî PROVIDE SPECIFIC PITCH-READY LANGUAGE  
- DO NOT DESCRIBE FEATURES WITHOUT EXPLAINING THE CUSTOMER BENEFIT
