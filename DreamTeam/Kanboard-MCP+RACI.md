# Kanboard Setup for RACI Matrix in Product Team

Based on the available Kanboard MCP server tools, here's a detailed setup guide for implementing a RACI matrix for product team responsibility distribution:

## 1. User and Group Creation

### Creating users by roles:
```bash
# Creating main roles
"Create user 'product_manager' with password 'secure123'"
"Create user 'product_owner' with password 'secure123'"
"Create user 'ux_designer' with password 'secure123'"
"Create user 'developer' with password 'secure123'"
"Create user 'qa_specialist' with password 'secure123'"
"Create user 'pmm_manager' with password 'secure123'"
"Create user 'data_analyst' with password 'secure123'"
"Create user 'growth_manager' with password 'secure123'"
"Create user 'cpo' with password 'secure123'"
"Create user 'business_analyst' with password 'secure123'"
"Create user 'project_manager' with password 'secure123'"
"Create user 'customer_success' with password 'secure123'"
"Create user 'legal_counsel' with password 'secure123'"
```

### Creating groups for better organization:
```bash
"Create a group named 'Product Team' with external ID 'prod_team'"
"Create a group named 'Development Team' with external ID 'dev_team'"
"Create a group named 'Design Team' with external ID 'design_team'"
"Create a group named 'QA Team' with external ID 'qa_team'"
"Create a group named 'Marketing Team' with external ID 'marketing_team'"
"Create a group named 'Management Team' with external ID 'management_team'"
"Create a group named 'Legal Team' with external ID 'legal_team'"
```

## 2. Project and Structure Creation

### Creating main project:
```bash
"Create a project called 'Product Development RACI' with description 'RACI matrix implementation for product team'"
```

### Setting up columns to reflect RACI statuses:
```bash
"Create a 'Planning (R-A)' column in project 'Product Development RACI' with 10 task limit and description 'Tasks in planning phase - Responsible and Accountable roles'"
"Create a 'In Progress (R)' column in project 'Product Development RACI' with 15 task limit and description 'Tasks being executed by Responsible parties'"
"Create a 'Review (A-C)' column in project 'Product Development RACI' with 8 task limit and description 'Tasks under review by Accountable and Consulted parties'"
"Create a 'Approved (A)' column in project 'Product Development RACI' with 5 task limit and description 'Tasks approved by Accountable party'"
"Create a 'Done (I)' column in project 'Product Development RACI' with 0 task limit and description 'Completed tasks - Informed parties notified'"
```

## 3. Creating Categories for RACI Matrix Task Types

```bash
"Create a 'Requirements Definition' category in project 'Product Development RACI' with color 'blue'"
"Create a 'Design & Prototyping' category in project 'Product Development RACI' with color 'green'"
"Create a 'Development' category in project 'Product Development RACI' with color 'yellow'"
"Create a 'Testing & Validation' category in project 'Product Development RACI' with color 'orange'"
"Create a 'Release Decision' category in project 'Product Development RACI' with color 'red'"
"Create a 'Technical Issues' category in project 'Product Development RACI' with color 'purple'"
"Create a 'Documentation' category in project 'Product Development RACI' with color 'grey'"
"Create a 'Status Updates' category in project 'Product Development RACI' with color 'brown'"
"Create a 'Legal Review' category in project 'Product Development RACI' with color 'pink'"
```

## 4. Creating Swimlanes for Different Responsibility Types

```bash
"Create a swimlane 'Accountable Tasks' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Create a swimlane 'Responsible Tasks' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Create a swimlane 'Consulted Tasks' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Create a swimlane 'Informed Tasks' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
```

## 5. Creating Tags for RACI Roles

```bash
"Create tag 'R-Responsible' for project 'Product Development RACI' with color 1"
"Create tag 'A-Accountable' for project 'Product Development RACI' with color 2"
"Create tag 'C-Consulted' for project 'Product Development RACI' with color 3"
"Create tag 'I-Informed' for project 'Product Development RACI' with color 4"
```

## 6. Assigning Users to Project with Appropriate Roles

```bash
# Leadership roles
"Add user 'cpo' to project 'Product Development RACI' with role 'project-manager'"
"Add user 'product_manager' to project 'Product Development RACI' with role 'project-manager'"
"Add user 'product_owner' to project 'Product Development RACI' with role 'project-manager'"
"Add user 'project_manager' to project 'Product Development RACI' with role 'project-manager'"

# Executive roles
"Add user 'ux_designer' to project 'Product Development RACI' with role 'project-member'"
"Add user 'developer' to project 'Product Development RACI' with role 'project-member'"
"Add user 'qa_specialist' to project 'Product Development RACI' with role 'project-member'"
"Add user 'business_analyst' to project 'Product Development RACI' with role 'project-member'"

# Consultative roles
"Add user 'pmm_manager' to project 'Product Development RACI' with role 'project-member'"
"Add user 'data_analyst' to project 'Product Development RACI' with role 'project-member'"
"Add user 'growth_manager' to project 'Product Development RACI' with role 'project-member'"
"Add user 'customer_success' to project 'Product Development RACI' with role 'project-member'"

# Information roles
"Add user 'legal_counsel' to project 'Product Development RACI' with role 'project-viewer'"
```

## 7. Creating Template Tasks for Each RACI Matrix Type

```bash
# Example task for requirements definition
"Create task 'Define User Story Requirements' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Set tags 'R-Responsible', 'A-Accountable' for task 'Define User Story Requirements' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Assign task 'Define User Story Requirements' to user 'product_manager'"

# Example task for creating mockups
"Create task 'Create UI/UX Mockups' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Set tags 'R-Responsible', 'A-Accountable' for task 'Create UI/UX Mockups' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Assign task 'Create UI/UX Mockups' to user 'ux_designer'"

# Example task for development
"Create task 'Implement Feature Functionality' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Set tags 'R-Responsible', 'A-Accountable' for task 'Implement Feature Functionality' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Assign task 'Implement Feature Functionality' to user 'developer'"

# Example task for testing
"Create task 'Test and Validate Feature' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Set tags 'R-Responsible', 'A-Accountable' for task 'Test and Validate Feature' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Assign task 'Test and Validate Feature' to user 'qa_specialist'"

# Example task for release decision
"Create task 'Make Release Decision' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Set tags 'A-Accountable', 'C-Consulted' for task 'Make Release Decision' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Assign task 'Make Release Decision' to user 'product_manager'"

# Example task for legal review
"Create task 'Legal Review of Product Feature' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Set tags 'R-Responsible', 'A-Accountable' for task 'Legal Review of Product Feature' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Assign task 'Legal Review of Product Feature' to user 'legal_counsel'"
```

## 8. Setting Up Automatic Actions for RACI Processes

```bash
# Automatic notification when task moves to Review
"Create an action for project 'Product Development RACI', event 'task.move.column', action 'TaskAssignColorCategory', with params 'column_id:3, color_id:orange'"

# Automatic task closure when moved to Done
"Create an action for project 'Product Development RACI', event 'task.move.column', action 'TaskClose', with params 'column_id:5'"
```

## 9. Creating Metadata for RACI Status Tracking

```bash
# Example of adding metadata to a task
"Save metadata 'raci_responsible:product_manager, raci_accountable:product_owner, raci_consulted:ux_designer,developer, raci_informed:qa_specialist' for task 1"

# Example for different task types
"Save metadata 'raci_responsible:ux_designer, raci_accountable:ux_designer, raci_consulted:product_manager, raci_informed:developer' for task 2"

"Save metadata 'raci_responsible:developer, raci_accountable:developer, raci_consulted:qa_specialist, raci_informed:product_manager' for task 3"
```

## 10. Dashboard Setup for RACI Process Monitoring

Using available tools, create a reporting system:

```bash
# Get tasks by responsible parties
"Get tasks for 'Product Development RACI' project"

# Get project activity
"Show me activity for project 'Product Development RACI'"

# Get overdue tasks
"Show me overdue tasks for project 'Product Development RACI'"

# Get user dashboard
"Show me my dashboard"

# Get specific user tasks
"Get all tasks for user 'product_manager'"
```

## 11. RACI Matrix Implementation Examples

### Requirements Definition Process:
```bash
"Create task 'Define User Story for Login Feature' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Set tags 'R-Responsible', 'A-Accountable' for task 'Define User Story for Login Feature' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Assign task 'Define User Story for Login Feature' to user 'product_manager'"
"Create a comment 'PM and PO are responsible and accountable. UX Designer, Developer, QA, and Business Analyst should be consulted.' for task 'Define User Story for Login Feature' by user 'product_manager'"
```

### Design & Prototyping Process:
```bash
"Create task 'Create Login Page Mockups' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Set tags 'R-Responsible', 'A-Accountable' for task 'Create Login Page Mockups' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Assign task 'Create Login Page Mockups' to user 'ux_designer'"
"Create a comment 'UX Designer is responsible and accountable. PM and PO should be consulted for requirements alignment.' for task 'Create Login Page Mockups' by user 'ux_designer'"
```

### Development Process:
```bash
"Create task 'Implement Login Functionality' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Set tags 'R-Responsible', 'A-Accountable' for task 'Implement Login Functionality' in project 'Product Development RACI'"
"Assign task 'Implement Login Functionality' to user 'developer'"
"Create a comment 'Developer is responsible and accountable. QA should be consulted for testing requirements.' for task 'Implement Login Functionality' by user 'developer'"
```

## 12. Best Practices for RACI Implementation

### Regular Updates:
```bash
# Update task metadata as RACI roles change
"Save metadata 'raci_responsible:new_responsible, raci_accountable:new_accountable' for task 1"

# Update task assignments
"Assign task 'Define User Story for Login Feature' to user 'business_analyst'"
```

### Communication Management:
```bash
# Add comments for RACI clarifications
"Create a comment 'RACI Update: Developer is now responsible, QA remains consulted' for task 1 by user 'project_manager'"

# Attach RACI documentation
"Create a file 'RACI_Matrix_v2.pdf' for project 'Product Development RACI' with base64 content '[base64_encoded_content]'"
```

### Monitoring and Reporting:
```bash
# Get project statistics
"Get all tasks for project 'Product Development RACI'"

# Monitor overdue tasks by role
"Show me overdue tasks for project 'Product Development RACI'"

# Track user workload
"Get all tasks assigned to user 'product_manager'"
```
