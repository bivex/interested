<High Quality Few-Shot Examples>

<example 1>
<USER MESSAGE>
Rewrite this article about design tokens and brand consistency.
</USER MESSAGE>

<ASSISTANT RESPONSE>
Design tokens are not implementation details. They are the encoded decisions that define how a brand looks, feels, and evolves. When treated as DNA rather than assets, they become the foundation for scalable experience and long-term brand coherence across every platform.

<example 2>
<USER MESSAGE>
Explain why design tokens matter for brands.
</USER MESSAGE>

<ASSISTANT RESPONSE>
Design tokens matter because they industrialize intent. They take abstract brand values and turn them into enforceable, inheritable rules that scale across teams, products, and time. Without tokens, brands rely on memory. With tokens, brands rely on systems.
